Hi!, I’m a Research Scientist at [The University of Arizona](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/about/staff), where I collaborate with the [CLU Lab](https://clulab.org) and [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.arizona.edu). My expertise lies in leveraging large language models to transform unstructured text into structured insights, with a particular focus on the biomedical domain. I’m passionate about creating smart search tools that empower researchers and scholars to uncover valuable insights from complex data.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of contributing to several impactful projects. As a co-PI of [SKEMA](https://ml4ai.github.io/skema/), part of [DARPA’s ASKEM](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/automating-scientific-knowledge-extraction-modeling) program, I worked on automating scientific knowledge extraction and modeling. I also served as the lead AI researcher for [AZHealthTXT](https://azhealthtxt.arizona.edu), focusing on developing text-based tools to support healthcare innovation. Additionally, I am a core contributor to [REACH](https://github.com/clulab/reach), an open-source, neuro-symbolic information extraction system designed to advance cancer biology research.
