      description: "Reach stands for Reading and Assembling Contextual and Holistic Mechanisms from Text. In plain English, Reach is an information extraction system for the biomedical domain, which aims to read scientific literature and extract cancer signaling pathways. Reach implements a fairly complete extraction pipeline, including: recognition of biochemical entities (proteins, chemicals, etc.), grounding them to known knowledge bases such as Uniprot, extraction of BioPAX-like interactions, e.g., phosphorylation, complex assembly, positive/negative regulations, and coreference resolution, for both entities and interactions."
